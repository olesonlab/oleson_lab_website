E komo mai!\n\nThank you for visiting the site of the Oleson Ecological Economics lab within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.\nWe are a diverse and interdisciplinary group interested in developing management-relevant analyses and tools. We focus on natural resource and environmental management problems spanning the mountain top to the coral reef. We employ a multitude of approaches, from quantification and valuation of ecosystem goods and services, data-driven and participatory modeling, value chain analysis, alternative economic welfare indicators, policy analysis, and decision science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
