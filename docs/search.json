    "text": "Project: Sustaining Crane Conservation Through Farmer Participation: Insights from Incentive Structures and Willingness-to-Accept in Crane-Friendly Rice Farming   Description: Biodiversity-friendly farming is essential for sustaining conservation and rural livelihoods in wetland rice systems. In Cambodia, the Crane-Friendly Rice Project applies Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) to protect Sarus Crane feeding habitats by offering farmers financial incentives, technical support, and market access. As current subsidies are set to expire by 2031, the long-term sustainability of these practices remains uncertain. This study investigates how farmers perceive existing incentives and estimates the minimum compensation required to continue biodiversity-friendly practices post-subsidy. One hundred farmers—equally divided between participants and non-participants—will take part in a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE), while focus group discussions will explore their motivations and perceived benefits.   Impact: By integrating quantitative and qualitative data, the study will provide practical recommendations for improving contract design and informing future conservation policy. The findings will help strengthen the long-term viability of biodiversity-friendly rice farming in Cambodia and similar PES-based initiatives elsewhere.   Funding Goal: $2,000 \n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Coastal zones are popular recreational areas that substantially contribute to social welfare. Managers can use information about specific environmental features that people appreciate, and how these might change under different management scenarios, to spatially target actions to areas of high current or potential value. We explored how snorkelers’ experience would be affected by separate and combined land and marine management actions in West Maui, Hawaiʻi, using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) and a spatially explicit ecosystem services model. The BBN simulates recreational attractiveness by combining snorkelers’ preferences for coastal features with experts’ opinions on ecological dynamics, snorkeler behavior, and management actions. A choice experiment with snorkelers elucidated their preferences for sites with better ecological and water-quality conditions. Linking the economic elicitation to the spatially explicit BBN to evaluate land-sea management scenarios provides specific guidance on where and how to act in West Maui to maximize ecosystem service returns. Improving coastal water quality through sediment runoff and cesspool effluent reductions, and enhancing coral reef ecosystem conditions, positively affected overall snorkeling attractiveness across the study area, but with differential results at specific sites. The highest improvements were attained through joint land-sea management, driven by strong effects of efforts to increase fish abundance and reduce sediment, however, management priorities at individual beaches varied.\n\n   Download Data         Read Article"
