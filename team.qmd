</center><br>

I am an interdisciplinary sustainability scientist. My overarching goal is to ensure that the value of nature is captured in national, state, and community decision-making. I employ tools from economics, social science, ecology, and decision analysis to provide rigorous foundations for discussions of what trade-offs societies are willing to make in the name of increasing short-term economic productivity. I engage with national and state policy makers and local communities over a wide range of resource management, economic development, and conservation issues that are of direct and urgent relevance to the state of Hawaiʻi and other Pacific Islands, such as food security, climate adaptation, and sustainable economic growth. I teach the graduate core courses, as well as a graduate policy analysis class.

I serve on numerous advisory committees, including for the United Nations Global Coral Reef Fund, The United Nations System of Environmental and Economic Accounts Ocean Accounts working group, the Global Ocean Accounting Partnership, the Hawaiʻi Division of Aquatic Resources Holomua, and Blue Forests. I was confirmed to the City and County of Honolulu Climate Change Commission in 2024. In 2021, I was awarded a Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship.
